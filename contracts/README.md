# Publius Contracts

Publius is a set of proxy contracts than enable any front end to send the required publication information to a factory contract, which will deploy a new publication ERC721 contract and change ownership of the new publication to the specified author.

The maintainer of Publius, [sekaieth](https://github.com/sekaieth), will retain ownership over the Beacon contract and the factory contract, and as such will have the ability to upgrade all deployed contracts if/when a new version of Publius is released.
