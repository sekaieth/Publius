The contract is implemented in Solidity, version 0.8.18, and uses the ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable contract from the OpenZeppelin library.\\n\\nThe contract has the following features:\\n\\n1 - Minting of tokens: The contract allows authors to mint tokens that represent ownership of a section, chapter, or page in the publication.\\n2 - Publication management: The contract allows authors to create, modify, and delete sections, chapters, and pages in the publication. Each section can contain multiple chapters, and each chapter can contain multiple pages.\\n3 - Token ownership tracking: The contract tracks the ownership of each token and how many tokens each minter has minted.\\n4 - Metadata storage: The contract stores metadata about the publication, such as the name of the publication, the author of the publication, the cover image of the publication, and the cost to mint a token.\\n5 - Access control: The contract uses the OwnableUpgradeable contract from the OpenZeppelin library to restrict access to certain functions to the owner of the contract.\\n6 - Upgradability: The contract uses the Initializable contract from the OpenZeppelin library to allow for upgradability.\\n\\nThe contract is authored by SÎžkai and is licensed under the MIT License."
